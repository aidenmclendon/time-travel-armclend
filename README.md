I am learning how to make a zine inside a Git repo!

GitIgnore Explanation: IWe ignore Jekyll’s build/cache directories (_site/, .jekyll-cache/, .sass-cache/, .jekyll-metadata) because they’re generated artifacts—GitHub Pages rebuilds from source. Local Bundler folders, such as .bundle/, vendor/, are excluded to keep the repo portable and clean.

Branches: 
author/idea-sprint: drafting new content and layouts.
editor/review: edits, proofreading, and merge conflict test
